# Planetary Stewardship based on EPA Indicators (EPA-indicators-CC)
Using Data Science and ML techniques to gleam insights on existing climate change trends

Inspired by Cornellâ€™s Introductory Environment and Ecology course (BIOEE 1610), I created this project to leverage Data Science and ML to gleam insight on environmental trends and contributors to global warming based on EPA indicators.

##### This project is written in Python (best opened in a notebook - ipynb format)

This project will have four major focuses and will touch upon 5 major Climate Change indicators as described by the EPA - (https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators)

1) Average temperature and climatic uncertainty trends

2) Agriculture Intensification and Meat Farming as major contributor to CO2 and Methane emissions and Nitrogen pollution

3) Forest Fires and forest Ecosystems

4) Health and Society (Human Development) as drivers of climate change


There is a number of datasets associated with the IPYNB file and the file must be opened in the same directory as these datasets
